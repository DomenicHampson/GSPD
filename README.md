<h4>GSPD can supply up to 250W of power, receiving input from either a generator or car batteries. It provides 5V, 12V and 24V lines to the ground equipement via an array of M12 connectors. The Kicad designed boards incorporate
    power protection mechanisms and are housed in a waterproof and dustproof housing with integrated cooling for optimal performance in all conditions.</h4>
